## 📝 Final Audit Summary

A Nessus Essentials scan was conducted on an Ubuntu EC2 instance hosted on AWS. The scan identified multiple vulnerabilities ranging from informational to high severity.

Key findings include:
- Open SSH services with weak configurations
- Exposed traceroute and timestamp data
- Backported or outdated software packages

Vulnerabilities were exported to Excel, analyzed, and mapped to relevant NIST 800-53 controls including:
- `AC-17` – Remote Access
- `SI-2` – Flaw Remediation
- `SC-7` – Boundary Protection

A Compliance Dashboard was created to track risk categories, remediation strategies, and compliance posture. All findings were marked as “Open” and prioritized for mitigation.

This project simulates a foundational GRC workflow from vulnerability discovery to control mapping, demonstrating readiness for compliance and risk analyst responsibilities.
